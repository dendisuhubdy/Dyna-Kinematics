# How to build this project

## Windows

### Installing the required tools and dependencies

#### CMake

- You will need CMake version 3.17.3 or newer to generate the files that you can use to build this project.
- You can download CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/).

#### GLFW

- You will need GLFW version 3.3 or newer, since that library is used for the window of the simulator viewer.
- You can download GLFW from [here](https://www.glfw.org/download.html).

#### Qt

- You will need Qt version 5.15.0 or newer (although older versions should work too), since that library is used for the UI of the simulation controller.
- You can download the Qt Online Installer from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). Use it to install Qt for open source development.
- In the `Select Components` page of the Qt Online Installer, select the option that corresponds to the compiler that you will be using that's under `5.15.0` and don't change anything else. In my case I'm using Visual Studio 2019, so I chose the `MSVC 2019 64-bit` option:

</p>

#### FFmpeg

- You will need FFmpeg, since that executable is used to generate GIFs when you record simulations.
- You can download FFmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- Make sure to add the path of the directory that contains `ffmpeg.exe` to your `PATH` environment variable, since this project expects to be able to invoke it globally.

### Using CMake to generate the files that you can use to build this project

- Launch CMake.
- In the `Where is the source code:` field, enter the path to the root of this repository, that is, the path to the directory that contains the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
- In the `Where to build the binaries:` field, enter the path to the directory where you want the project to be built. Make sure this directory is outside of the repository.
- Click on the `Configure` button. You will be asked which generator you would like to use. In my case I would like to build the project using Visual Studio 2019, so I chose the `Visual Studio 16 2019` option:

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/diegomacario/Dyna-Kinematics/blob/master/readme_images/CMake_Choose_Generator_Windows.PNG"/>
</p>

- After selecting the generator, you might see an error that looks like this:

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/diegomacario/Dyna-Kinematics/blob/master/readme_images/CMake_Qt_Error_Windows.PNG"/>
</p>

- To fix it, enter the path to the following directory of your Qt installation in the `Qt5_DIR-NOTFOUND` field: `\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\lib\cmake\Qt5`. In my case, the full path is `C:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\lib\cmake\Qt5`, but this might change depending on where you installed Qt and what compiler you are using.

</p>

- Click on the `Configure` button again. You might see an error that looks like this:

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/diegomacario/Dyna-Kinematics/blob/master/readme_images/CMake_GLFW_Error_Windows.PNG"/>
</p>

- To fix it, enter the path to the following directory of your GLFW installation in the `glfw3_DIR-NOTFOUND` field: `\GLFW\lib\cmake\glfw3`. In my case, the full path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\GLFW\lib\cmake\glfw3`, but this might change depending on where you installed GLFW.

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/diegomacario/Dyna-Kinematics/blob/master/readme_images/CMake_GLFW_Fix_Windows.PNG"/>
</p>

- Click on the `Configure` button again. The configuration should succeed.
- Click on the `Generate` button. The generation should succeed.
- You should now be able to build the project using the files generated by CMake. Since I selected Visual Studio 2019 as my generator, CMake created a Visual Studio 2019 solution called `Dyna-Kinematics.sln` for me.

### Before launching the Dyna-Kinematics executable

- Copy the `resources` folder, which is at the root of this repository, to the directory that contains the Dyna-Kinematics executable. This is necessary because the `resources` folder contains a series of shaders that are compiled at runtime.
- Copy the DLLs listed below from the following directory of your Qt installation to the directory that contains the Dyna-Kinematics executable: `\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\bin`. In my case, the full path is `C:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\bin`, but this might change depending on where you installed Qt and what compiler you are using.
  - Qt5Core.dll
  - Qt5Gui.dll
  - Qt5Widgets.dll
- Note that if you built the project in `Debug` mode, you should copy the debug DLLs instead:
  - Qt5Cored.dll
  - Qt5Guid.dll
  - Qt5Widgetsd.dll
- You should now be able to launch Dyna-Kinematics successfully!

## macOS

#### CMake

- You will need CMake version 3.17.3 or newer to generate the files that you can use to build this project.
- You can download CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/) or using this command:

```sh
$ brew install cmake
```

#### GLFW

- You will need GLFW version 3.3 or newer, since that library is used for the window of the simulator viewer.
- You can download GLFW from [here](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) or using this command:

```sh
$ brew install glfw
```

#### Qt

- You will need Qt version 5.15.0 or newer (although older versions should work too), since that library is used for the UI of the simulation controller.
- You can download the Qt Online Installer from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). Use it to install Qt for open source development.
- If you don't have Xcode installed, you will see a warning that says `You need to install Xcode and set up Xcode command line tools...`. You can ignore it.
- In the `Select Components` page of the Qt Online Installer, select the `macOS` option that's under `5.15.0` and don't change anything else.

</p>

- Alternatively, you can also install Qt using the command below, although I have never done it this way so I don't know which components it installs.

```sh
$ brew install qt
```

#### FFmpeg

- You will need FFmpeg, since that application is used to generate GIFs when you record simulations.
- You can download FFmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- Make sure to add the path of the directory that contains `ffmpeg.exe` to your `PATH` environment variable, since this project expects to be able to invoke it globally.

### Using CMake to generate the files that you can use to build this project

- To fix it, enter the path to the following directory of your Qt installation in the "Qt5_DIR-NOTFOUND" field: /Qt/5.15.0/clang_64/cmake/qt5. In my case, the full path is /Users/diegomacario/Qt/5.15.0/clang_64/cmake/qt5, but this might change depending on where you installed Qt and what compiler you are using.
- Click on the "Configure" button again.
- The configuration should succeed.
- Click on the "Generate" button.
- The generation should succeed.
- You should now be able to build the project by executing the following command in the directory that you entered for the "Where to build the binaries:" field:

```sh
$ make
```

- The build should succeed.
- Finally, you should be able to launch this project by executing the following command in the same directory:

```sh
$ ./Dyna-Kinematics
```
